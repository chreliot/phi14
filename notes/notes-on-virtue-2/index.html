<h2 id="aristotle-defines-virtues-nicomachean-ethics">Aristotle defines virtues (<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>)</h2>
<h3 id="dispositions">Dispositions</h3>
<pre><code>Souls can moved in 3 ways: feelings, capacities, and dispositions.

We are praised for virtues.
We are not praised (or blamed) for feelings.
So, virtues are not feelings.

We are praised for virtues.
We are not praised (or blamed) for capacities.
So, virtues are not capacities.

So, virtues are dispositions.
</code></pre>
<p>“The human soul is conditioned in three ways.” = 3 features of the soul—or features of our minds we might say—lie behind what we do, motivating or enabling what we do. They are feelings, capacities and dispositions. Virtues are not feelings of capacities, so virtues are dispositions.</p>
<p>Dispositions are things we are <em>disposed</em> to do—perhaps  tendencies produced by an internal drive. It may be straightforward to think of them as <em>habits</em>. We normally acquire virtues the same way we acquire habits: repeating a behavior creates a disposition in us to continue to do it. Such a disposition is normally not entirely conscious, deliberate, or intentional. But it may be shaped by our deciding to continue repeating it, repeating it with modification, or trying to break the habit.</p>
<h3 id="virtues-are-relative-in-some-way">Virtues are relative in some way</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Let ten pounds of food be a large, and two pounds a small, allowance for an athlete. It does not follow that the trainer will prescribe six pounds. … It would be a little for Milo but a lot for a man who has just begun his training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, how much is the right amount to eat depends on what we&rsquo;re like, and isn&rsquo;t just a matter of finding the halfway point between the most and the least.</p>
<h3 id="aligning-pleasurepain-with-virtuevice">Aligning pleasure/pain with virtue/vice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If we feel [pleasures and pains] too much or too little, we are wrong. But to have these feelings at the right times on the right occasions towards the right people for the right motive and in the right way is to have them in the right measure, that is somewhere between the extremes; and this is what characterizes goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are facts about when is best and not best to feel certain ways. The virtuous person feels pleasure in acting virtuously and pain in not doing so.</p>
<h3 id="many-evils-one-good">Many evils, one good</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>it is possible to go wrong in more ways than one. … But there is only one way of being right. That is why going wrong is easy, and going right difficult; it is easy to miss the bull&rsquo;s eye and difficult to hit it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can fail to hit the mark by erring on the side of too much or too little. But also, as the virtues are mutually reinforcing, there are many ways of missing the mark on one virtue that compromises us on all the others.</p>
<h3 id="summary-definition-of-virtue">Summary definition of virtue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We may now define virtue as a disposition of the soul in which, when it has to choose among actions and feelings, it observes the mean relative to us, this being determined by such a rule or principle as would take shape in the mid of a man of sense or practical wisdom. We call it a mean condition as lying between the two forms of badness, one being excess and the other deficiency; and also for this reason, that, whereas badness either falls short of or exceeds the right measure in feelings and actions, virtue discovers the mean and deliberately chooses it. Thus … judged by the standard of what is right and best, [virtue] is an extreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="potential-problems">Potential problems</h2>
<p>Is there a right amount of revenge? Why or why not? Aristotle says that there&rsquo;s not a right amount of adultery, nor adultery practiced in the right way with the right person at the right time, etc. But why not?</p>
