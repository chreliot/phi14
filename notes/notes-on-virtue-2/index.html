<h3 id="dispositions">Dispositions</h3>
<pre><code>We are praised for virtues.
We are not praised (or blamed) for feelings.
So, virtues are not feelings.

We are praised for virtues.
We are not praised (or blamed) for capacities.
So, virtues are not capacities.
</code></pre>
<p>“The human soul is conditioned in three ways.” = 3 states of the soul behind what we do, motivating/enabling what we do. They are feelings, capacities and dispositions.
Virtues are not feelings of capacities.</p>
<p>So, virtues are dispositions.</p>
<h3 id="virtues-are-relative-in-some-way">Virtues are relative in some way</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Let ten pounds of food be a large, and two pounds a small, allowance for an athlete. It does not follow that the trainer will prescribe six pounds. … It would be a little for Milo but a lot for a man who has just begun his training.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aligning-pleasurepain-with-virtuevice">Aligning pleasure/pain with virtue/vice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If we feel [pleasures and pains] too much or too little, we are wrong. But to have these feelings at the right times on the right occasions towards the right people for the right motive and in the right way is to have them in the right measure, that is somewhere between the extremes; and this is what characterizes goodness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are facts about when is best and not best to feel certain ways. The virtuous person feels pleasure in acting virtuously and pain in not doing so.</p>
<h3 id="many-evils-one-good">Many evils, one good</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>it is possible to go wrong in more ways than one. … But there is only one way of being right. That is why going wrong is easy, and going right difficult; it is easy to miss the bull&rsquo;s eye and difficult to hit it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="summary-definition-of-virtue">Summary definition of virtue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We may now define virtue as a disposition of the soul in which, when it has to choose among actions and feelings, it observes the mean relative to us, this being determined by such a rule or principle as would take shape in the mid of a man of sense or practical wisdom. We call it a mean condition as lying between the two forms of badness, one being excess and the other deficiency; and also for this reason, that, whereas badness either falls short of or exceeds the right measure in feelings and actions, virtue discovers the mean and deliberately chooses it. Thus … judged by the standard of what is right and best, [virtue] is an extreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="potential-problems">Potential problems</h2>
<p>Is there a right amount of revenge? Why or why not? Aristotle says that there&rsquo;s not a right amount of adultery, nor adultery practiced in the right way with the right person at the right time, etc. But why not?</p>
