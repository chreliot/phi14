<h1 id="applying-kantianism">Applying Kantianism</h1>
<p>Two versions of the Categorical Imperative:</p>
<ol>
<li>Act in such a way that you can will your maxim to be a universal law (of nature) (without contradiction). [&ldquo;The formula of universal law&rdquo; or &ldquo;the first formulation&rdquo;]</li>
<li>Act in such a way that you treat humanity — in yourself or others — always as an end in itself and never merely as means. [&ldquo;The formula of humanity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the second formulation&rdquo;]</li>
</ol>
<p>Elaborating on the second formation: Beings with their own wills (and thus the capacity to lay down ends, as part of the act of willing things) must  respect other such beings as &ldquo;ends in themselves&rdquo; (things with their own purposes).  Having such purpose is an essential part of being a human rational agent. To respect something as an end it itself requires <em>never</em> using it merely to achieve our own ends <em>without</em> respect its ability to will its own ends.</p>
<p>Informally: We act wrongly when we use others without respecting their ability to set goals for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>You didn&rsquo;t study for your science test, and so you think about looking at someone else&rsquo;s test (without their knowledge) while taking the test and copying the answers on your test.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Analysis in terms of the first formulation:</strong> If everyone were to do this, could that occur (without contradiction)? A maxim: When I&rsquo;m worried I won&rsquo;t do well on a test, I will copy someone else&rsquo;s answers, to do well on the test.
Universalized: When anyone is worried they won&rsquo;t do well on a test, they will copy others&rsquo; answers, to do well on the test.
Could that work without contradiction? Would that goal be realized in a situation where that were a law of nature? No. This situation, where people do well on the test, through everyone copying someone else who hasn&rsquo;t studied, isn&rsquo;t imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis in terms of the second formulation:</strong> The people involved are you and the person copied from and also potentially other students. The person copied from may be being used without their consent and in a way that potentially interferes with their ability to do well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In order to be happy, you use a narcotic with a high-probability of addiction and negative cognitive impact, because you&rsquo;re not feeling happy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First formulation analysis:</strong> Arguably, if everyone does this, people won&rsquo;t be happy. So, we can&rsquo;t will this without contradiction.  Or, perhaps, this cannot actually produce happiness for us?</p>
<p><strong>Second formulation analysis:</strong> Arguably, this involves using oneself merely as means, interfering with your future ability to freely set goals. It could also involve dependence on others in way that, since they didn&rsquo;t have a choice, uses them merely as means. It could involve using others depending on us as means (by neglecting our duties to maintaining their freedom of will for our own purposes).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>What about Foot&rsquo;s example of transplants from an unwilling donor? It&rsquo;s a clear case of using someone merely as means, without their consent. It&rsquo;s also probably a case of something that everyone couldn&rsquo;t do because the goals of medicine would fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about Williams&rsquo;s case of choosing between killing one person or walking away and allowing 20 to be killed? Is he using his son merely as a means if he chooses to shoot him to save 20? Is he using 20 merely as means if he allows them to be shot to save his son? In either case is he using himself? Arguably we use the son if we shoot him, but then do we also use the other 20, e.g., for our peace of mind, if we walk away?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If our friend is cheating (as in the case we analyzed using Util.) and their partner asks us whether they&rsquo;re cheating, we have the options of telling the truth and thereby producing unhappiness or alternatively lying and avoiding making people angry/upset, etc. Lying is wrong, says the Kantian. We shouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
