<p>Blackburn distinguishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>reasons (<strong>r</strong>): motivating considerations for those who care about them</li>
<li>Reasons (<strong>R</strong>): motivation considerations for EVERYONE, independent of their sympathies and inclinations (what they care about and their feelings)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, are there any &ldquo;Reasons&rdquo;? Are there sources of rightness/goodness that should motivate everyone (all rational beings)?</p>
<h2 id="egoism">Egoism</h2>
<p>Profitability/benefits for me (the person motivated by the reason) are what&rsquo;s fundamentally good.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BUT: This allows only individual goods. So, to the extent that this is the source of goodness, ethics, in the sense of a community establishing what&rsquo;s right, becomes impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BUT: If nobody else can see what&rsquo;s motivating about what benefits me, then perhaps it&rsquo;s merely a subjective, not an objective good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="might-makes-right">Might makes right</h2>
<p>What the stronger say is right is right.</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: This view will probably not motivating to very many besides the strongest. Can&rsquo;t be a &ldquo;Reason.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relativism">Relativism</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s right is what our culture says is right ( = what&rsquo;s right is right <em>for</em> a particular culture.)</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: What&rsquo;s right is right only within a particular culture, we can&rsquo;t resolve intercultural conflicts — there&rsquo;s nothing to appeal to to do that, anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theistic--divine-command">Theistic / divine command</h2>
<p>What God wants is what&rsquo;s good.</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: We arguably don&rsquo;t know what God wants, especially about specific cases.</li>
<li>BUT: Many people don&rsquo;t agree that any god exists.</li>
<li>BUT: If ethics is to include secular and religious community members, there need to be reasons transcending God&rsquo;s will. Fortunately, the Euthyphro argument suggests there can be those, even if God exists and promotes what&rsquo;s right.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h2>
<p>Happiness is intrinsically good; pain/displeasure are intrinsically bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: There&rsquo;s insufficient support for everyone&rsquo;s happiness always being good.</li>
<li>BUT: We disapprove of the happiness of scoundrels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kantianism">Kantianism</h2>
<p>Good wills are intrinsically good.</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: What&rsquo;s good can sometimes result from actions NOT done from good will.</li>
<li>BUT: Being rational doesn&rsquo;t make someone good, worth respecting.</li>
<li>BUT: Kant arguably doesn&rsquo;t have a successful proof of the intrinsic goodness of good will.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aristotelian-virtue-ethics">(Aristotelian) Virtue Ethics</h2>
<p>Eudaimonia is intrinsically good for human beings, or the state in which we&rsquo;re doing best.</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: There is no objective state of flourishing for human beings; flourishing is diverse.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="are-there-alternatives-if-none-of-these-work">Are there alternatives if none of these work?</h1>
<h2 id="social-contract-theory">Social contract theory</h2>
<p>Scanlon: an act is wrong if it is rejected by the rules we would agree to, if informed and unforced</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t tie what&rsquo;s right to what we actually agree to, but rather to what we WOULD agree to, if informed and unforced and reasonable.</p>
<p>This makes actual or hypothetical agreement the basis of rightness.</p>
<p>Could ethics consist of the principles we (all) actually agree to?</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: We obviously don&rsquo;t agree, especially where ethics is relevant.</li>
<li>BUT: Any strategy for obtaining actual agreement from everyone is impossible/unworkable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could ethics consist of principles that we WOULD hypothetically agree to if given the option to weigh in?</p>
<ul>
<li>BUT: Do different perspectives make it impossible for us to agree on a set of principles?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seeking-a-common-point-of-view">Seeking a common point of view</h2>
<p>Blackburn describes an activity that&rsquo;s a prerequisite of society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us return to the business of giving and receiving reasons for action, or for attitudes in general/This is an activity that is necessary to us in society. But it is also an activity that seems to require a presupposition. The presupposition is that what I advance as a reason, a reason from my point of view, <em>can</em> be appreciated from <em>your</em> point of view. (129)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately we are capable of the common point of view here described. … There is no guarantee that we will come to the same conclusion, of course, but there is a guarantee that we <em>might</em> do so. And that is enough to make the conversation a rational option, better than imposition of one solution on everyone, by force or violence. (130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for Blackburn, behind the common point of view lies a passion, a feeling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the back of things there lies a passion: the concern to avoid imposition and manipulation, to be able to reject the charge that <em>their</em> interests have been discounted, and to find just the common standards that enable <em>us</em> to look them in the eye. These may be no more than concerns or passions, but they are all the concerns and passions that enable common humanity to go forward. (131–132)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not that ethics is all based just on a feeling. Rather, the continued existence of humanity depends on our being motivated by feelings to participate in the process of finding a common point of view.</p>
