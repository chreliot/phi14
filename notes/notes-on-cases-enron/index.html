<ol>
<li>How do the 3 major theories of philosophical ethics apply to real situations?</li>
<li>Do the three theories each/all succeed at revealing the ethical dimensions of the real situations?</li>
<li>Are there other ethical dimensions of the cases in addition to what these theories highlight?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="enron">Enron</h2>
<h3 id="an-amoral-analysis-of-the-case">An amoral analysis of the case</h3>
<p>Some very creative entrepreneurs created new markets, buying and selling what had never been traded before, and they made a lot of money doing that. A few of them broke some laws governing business and finance, and those people were punished for that. Justice was done. The company went bankrupt because of mismanagement. None of this has anything to do with ethics — this is a business and legal story, not an ethics story.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-actually-ethical-dimensions">Are there actually ethical dimensions?</h3>
<p>Abbreviations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>U</strong>: Utilitarianism</li>
<li><strong>K</strong>: Kantianism</li>
<li><strong>V</strong>: Virtue ethics</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong to sell a necessity for profit.
BUT: we&rsquo;ve always sold housing, food …
BUT: Does this apply when we don&rsquo;t have a choice of vendor, especially monopolies? (K: this actively undermines others' freedom of choice)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit derived from preventing others from getting what they need is unethical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay and Skilling lied to employees, investing employees, and non-employee investors about how well the company was doing, what the sources of revenue are. (K: clear formula of humanity violation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scandal tarnished by association the reputations of peripheral people and companies who didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. (U: bad consequence)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments should have diminished opportunities for wrongdoing — should have tried not to leave open opportunities for wrongdoing.</p>
<ul>
<li>SEC should have investigated and regulated more aggressively.</li>
<li>California&rsquo;s deregulation of the energy market opened the possibility of artificially creating energy shortages for profit.
(K: maybe NOT intervening amounts to using others merely as means)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enron&rsquo;s leadership displayed questionable character more broadly (V: are there non-virtuous behaviors displayed? Greed — wanting more for oneself than you can justly acquire? Risky behavior. Exclusionary behavior. Using others.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The executive&rsquo;s suicide was an outcome. (K: suicide is using yourself wrongly as merely a means; U: it&rsquo;s a bad consequence of some actions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individuals tried to do the right thing for their families by making seemingly-safe investments and accumulating pension with a stable employer lost almost everything. (U: these are bad consequences; K: violation of formula of humanity/2nd CI)</p>
</li>
</ul>
