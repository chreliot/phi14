<h2 id="the-expediency-objection">The expediency objection</h2>
<p>Philippa Foot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no-one would suspect the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foot: This makes utilitarianism monstrous, if it suggests we can harm one person to help others. And that can&rsquo;t be morally right.</p>
<p>So, what should we conclude from that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilitarianism is a bad moral theory because it sometimes promotes morally wrong acts.</li>
<li>We can improve/modify Utilitarianism so that it no longer promotes morally wrong acts. (It doesn&rsquo;t actually say one should do those things.)</li>
<li>We can conclude that what <em>seems</em> morally wrong is not actually wrong. (Utilitarianism isn&rsquo;t wrong, but rather our moral intuitions about what&rsquo;s wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mill, in the Expediency section, seems to embrace the second option.</p>
<h2 id="rule-utilitarianism">Rule utilitarianism</h2>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve interpreted the Greatest Happiness Principle as applying to individual actions (“Does this action, or a different one, maximize overall happiness?”). But, we might instead we might apply it to the adoption of rules:</p>
<p>So, wherever they apply, act according to those rules, the adoption of which by everyone, would promote the greatest overall happiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t normally lie</li>
<li>seek consent whenever there&rsquo;s a potential for harm</li>
<li>keep your promises</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t murder</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: some cases seem to call for exceptions [murderer at the door should be lied to, but that breaks the no-lying rule]. If there are exceptions to rules, are they really rules?</p>
<p>Mill: Rule utilitarians should work to define the specific, necessary exceptions as such.</p>
