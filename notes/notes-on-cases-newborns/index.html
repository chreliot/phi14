<h2 id="_moral-dilemmas--can-ethics-help_"><em>Moral dilemmas … can ethics help?</em></h2>
<p>What is the moral dilemma?</p>
<ul>
<li>keep newborns alive by any means necessary</li>
<li>allow them to pass away peacefully</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="utilitarian-considerations">Utilitarian considerations</h3>
<p>4–5% (?) chance that the newborns, if treated, would develop severe disabilities, potentially reducing their quality of life, and making them dependent on others. (Would the newborns be unhappy in their lives, in comparison with ending them?)</p>
<p>Would people&rsquo;s time and resources be unnecessarily consumed by taking care of the infants, where it could also be spent on other goods?</p>
<p>Doctors are affected in terms of work level, emotional experience, and income.</p>
<p>Parents' emotions affected negatively by distance from children. Would they be be less happy (or more happy) in a care role?</p>
<p>Utilitarian verdict?</p>
<h3 id="kantian-considerations">Kantian considerations</h3>
<p>What kind of actions are the parents considering willing?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s their potential maxim of action? Can it be universalized without contradiction?</p>
<ul>
<li>Given premature birth, I will help the newborns live by providing all necessary medical treatment.</li>
<li>Given premature birth, I will help the newborns live by allowing them to die. XXX</li>
<li>Given premature birth, to minimize suffering, I will allow them to die.</li>
<li>Given circumstances of pre mature birth in order for my children not to suffer in this world I’m allowing them to pass on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do all their options treat humanity as an end in itself and never merely as means?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is anyone being used? (Infants, medical staff)</li>
<li>Are the infants potentially used MERELY as means
<ul>
<li>Yes, if they wouldn&rsquo;t choose suffering for themselves, but their parents make them suffer so the parents can continue to parent.</li>
<li>If the infants are allowed to die, then the parents could be using the children for their own happiness so long as they&rsquo;re alive, and discarding them when they fail to contribute to the parents' happiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, Kant thought that it&rsquo;s mature rationality, like most adults have, that makes you need to be respected as an end in yourself. But infants aren&rsquo;t full rational agents, and they don&rsquo;t get full respect from Kant. Kant recommends that we shouldn&rsquo;t treat rational-agent-like beings as means either, because that&rsquo;s too close to treating rational agents as means. It creates a bad habit.</p>
<p>A Kantian could also focus on ways in which the infants have the potential to become rational agents. Their value would lie in their potential to become that.</p>
<h3 id="virtue-ethics-considerations">Virtue ethics considerations</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What would a virtuous person (= a person who has all the virtues and is flourishing/happy/in a state of eudaimonia) do in this situation? What virtues are relevant to this situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might our actions affect others' capacity for virtue, and thus for eudaimonia?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What virtues of the parents are relevant to the situation?</p>
<p>Parents'</p>
<ul>
<li>sensitivity to/concern for others&rsquo;s well-being</li>
<li>taking the long view / practical wisdom about the full scope of life</li>
<li>other/outward-focus to the appropriate degree “objectivity”/
proper judgment about the children&rsquo;s well-being</li>
<li>courage</li>
<li>justice</li>
</ul>
<p>Newborns: How would our helping them survive affect their capacity to live a human life of flourishing?</p>
<h3 id="is-anything-missing-in-the-above-what">Is anything missing in the above? What?</h3>
<ul>
<li>rights?
<ul>
<li>right to life?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
