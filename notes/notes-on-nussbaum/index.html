<h2 id="objections">Objections:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Even if all human lives involve the &ldquo;grounding experience&rdquo; that calls for each of the virtues — for example, facing dangers, to which &ldquo;courage&rdquo; is the proper response, we may be left with &ldquo;competing answers to a single general question about a set of shared human experiences, … and what has been achieved is, at best, a single discourse or debate about virtue.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Objector: Virtue ethics is susceptible to relativism
Virtue Theorist: But the grounding spheres of experience are common to all human lives
Objector: But this shows we can have a shared debate about what the right reponse to them is. It doesn&rsquo;t show that there are virtues that are true for all cultures.</p>
<p>NUSSBAUM: The objective, true account of each virtue might have the form of a disjunction (A or B or …). So, it would be a short list of what behaviors/habits could count as that virtue without committing us to &ldquo;ANYTHING GOES.&rdquo; Cultural variation doesn&rsquo;t conflict with objectivity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Grounding experiences differ among cultures, as influenced by language, teaching, past experience. If so, people in different cultures may not even have grounding experiences in common. So, there would be no universal virtues that would be the right approach to those shared experiences.</li>
</ol>
<p>NUSSBAUM:</p>
<p>a. Some ways of interpreting the world are simply stupid or pernicious or false, and we should reject them. (Again, we don&rsquo;t have to accept that “anything goes.”)
b. Also, even if we frame the world and our experiences very differently, there are shared human challenges that seem to shine through them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>There could be human lives that don&rsquo;t contain the grounding experiences at all, but still are fully human.</li>
</ol>
<p>NUSSBAUM:</p>
<p>a. Some ways of removing limitations from human lives <em>would</em>, arguably, render them no longer human, as someone who couldn&rsquo;t die would arguably no longer be living a human life, but rather a god-like life.
b. But even cases where someone clearly human no longer experiences a particular sphere of life (property, socializing, pain, etc.), they arguably exchange one kind of limitation for others, and the bulk of virtues as ways to approach such limitations will still apply to them.</p>
