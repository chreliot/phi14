<h2 id="evolutionary-theory">Evolutionary theory</h2>
<p>Evolution by natural selection: If organisms have heritable (= can be inherited, passed from parents to offspring) characteristics in which they vary from one another, and some of those variations contribute to their survival-to-reproduce and reproduction), then we will tend to see an increase in those beneficial characteristics over time. Most of the diversity of living things can be explained this way.</p>
<p>Ethics is a behavior. So, can we explain it by natural selection?</p>
<p>Ethics could be a sexually-selected behavior.</p>
<p>Our biological impulses might be self-serving? Does ethics remain without society?</p>
<p>Darwin (1871) <em>Descent of Man</em>: Our early ancestors would have benefitted from banding together in groups. Well-coordinated groups would have tended to survive conflicts with other groups better. Their members would have benefitted also from mutual-aid within the groups. If some group members acquired a <em>heritable</em> tendency toward group-benefitting behavior, that tendency would have tended to spread in the group.</p>
<p>We could also have cultural inheritance as a third mode of selection.</p>
<p>Puzzle: the most self-sacrificing/altruistic people might, for example, die most in wartime. Shouldn&rsquo;t that undermine the spread of a tendency to self-sacrifice?  - Possible answer: Not if if the benefits of altruism outweigh this.</p>
<p><strong>Worry 1</strong>: Does evolution make us all selfish?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The above shows three mechanisms through which altruism could evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Worry 2</strong>: If we can explain ethics biologically, any apparently-altruistic behavior might be merely an expression of our biology, and so <em>not real</em>. Ethics/altruism  becomes merely a fitness-enhancing behavior, whereas we might want it to be more than that: perhaps a social standard, organizing principle, or genuine, rather than merely automatic, programmed.</p>
<h2 id="blackburns-three-confusions-to-guard-against">Blackburn&rsquo;s three confusions to guard against</h2>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;We can explain how we are.&rdquo; ≠ “We are different from what we think we are.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if we can explain biologically why mothers normally love babies, it doesn&rsquo;t follow from that that mothers' love isn&rsquo;t <em>real</em>. In fact, that we can explain a behavior biologically means it <em>is</em> biologically real. So there&rsquo;s an error in thinking our kindness, for example, is merely biology and so not real.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Inferring the impossibility of a concern existing from the fact that we don&rsquo;t have a biological explanation for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading psychology into nature. Even if natural selection involves a competition among genes, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that our human moral environment is fundamentally competitive or selfish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="should-selfish-agents-cooperate">Should selfish agents cooperate?</h1>
<p>Game show example: Contestants accumulate big cash rewards. But then, two contestants are set against each other and given the choice of &ldquo;share or steal.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Both share: each gets half</li>
<li>One shares and the other steals: Stealer gets all, sharer gets none</li>
<li>Both steal: neither gets any</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this show a model of any real situations we encounter?</p>
<p>Possibly similar to:</p>
<ul>
<li>taxation? we decide to tax ourselves (by voting for tax-supporting politicians) and that&rsquo;s like sharing, whereas not taxing and providing services would be like stealing</li>
<li>betraying the trust of our collaborators</li>
</ul>
<p>What kinds of situations have the selfish choice also be the collaborative one?</p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-game-theory">Evolutionary game theory</h2>
<p>Framework for modeling competitive and prosocial behavior.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;game&rdquo; has agents, options, and quantified payoffs depicted in matrix.</p>
<h3 id="prisoners-dilemma-game">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma game</h3>
<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperate (C) - keep trust with colleague</li>
<li>Defect (D) - break trust with colleague</li>
</ul>
<p>Payoff matrix for player 1 (vertical)</p>
<pre><code>   C    D
		 
C  3    1

D  4    2
</code></pre><p>Strategies for a single game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on risk level: Choose the option with the highest payoff that also has a risk level you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</li>
<li>Focus on maximum benefit: Choose the option with the highest payoff</li>
<li>Focus on communal benefit: Choose option where everyone does best</li>
<li>Focus on expected value: Choose option with the highest average payoff</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="complications-of-games">Complications of games</h2>
<ul>
<li>Iterated game: repeated game, where each player knows how the other played in the past, increasingly. Axelrod discovered the winning strategy for this is “Tit for Tat”: Start by cooperating, but then defect once whenever the other player defects (in the previous game), but then go back to collaborating.</li>
<li>Explicit communication among players</li>
<li>Alternative payoff matrices</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stag-hunt-game">Stag Hunt game</h3>
<pre><code>	 Stag  Hare 
Stag  4,4   1,3
Hare  3,1   2,2
</code></pre><p>where, for X,Y, X is player 1&rsquo;s payoff and Y is player 2&rsquo;s payoff</p>
<p>In Stag Hunt games, we do best by cooperating.</p>
<p>What situations in our actual lives, if any, have the structure of one of these games?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two people go into business. This is like Stag Hunt. We do better economically if we work together.</li>
<li>Marriage. Shared income/resources, guaranteed companionship. Vs. cheating on the relationship.</li>
<li>Trying to be more carbon neutral.</li>
<li>Holding onto a friend&rsquo;s juicy secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We might model these cases as like game-theoretic games, and we can see that</p>
<ul>
<li>even if we assume selfish interest as exclusive motivator, the cooperative solution can be optimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is: Are actual situations well modeled by games where cooperation does best, or not?</p>
