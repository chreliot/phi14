<h2 id="euthyphro-plato"><em>Euthyphro</em> (Plato)</h2>
<p>Where: outside the courthouse</p>
<p><em>hoison</em> = piety, holiness, righteousness, respectfulness toward gods, respectfulness</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> is facing trial for</p>
<ul>
<li>corrupting the youth</li>
<li>rejecting the gods of Athens (lacking <em>hoison</em>)</li>
<li>inventing false gods</li>
</ul>
<p>Socrates defends his actions as displaying <em>hoison</em></p>
<p><strong>Euthyphro</strong> is at court pressing charges against his father</p>
<p>Socrates reacts with surprise at Euthyphro&rsquo;s impiety towards his father — his lack of <em>hoison</em></p>
<h2 id="the-euthyphro-dilemma">The Euthyphro dilemma</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>But if in fact what is dear to the gods and the holy were the same, my friend, then, if the holy were loved because it is holy, what is dear to the gods would be loved because it is dear to the gods; but if what is dear to the gods were dear to the gods because the gods love it, the holy would be holy because it is loved. But as it is, you see, the opposite is true, and the two are completely different. For the one (what is clear to the gods) is of the sort to be loved because it is loved; the other (the holy), because it is of the sort to be loved, therefore is loved. It would seem, Euthyphro, that when you asked what the holy is, you did not mean to make its nature and reality clear to me; you mentioned a mere affection of it—the holy has been so affected as to be loved by all the gods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question: What is holy/pious?</p>
<p>Euthyphro: What&rsquo;s holy is what all the gods love.</p>
<pre><code>    (or, what all the gods love = what God loves)
</code></pre>
<p>Socrates: So which one of the following do you agree with? What makes what&rsquo;s holy holy?</p>
<ul>
<li>what&rsquo;s holy is holy because God loves it</li>
<li>what God loves, God loves because it is holy</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: &ldquo;being kind&rdquo; — what makes that right?</p>
<ul>
<li>God loves it / approves of it / commands it. The reason being kind is good is that God chose it to be right. This entails that God <em>could</em> have chosen that being kind is wrong, or that murder is right. This makes God&rsquo;s choices about rights and wrongs <em>arbitrary</em>.</li>
<li>The reason being kind is good is that it&rsquo;s a good thing, and God recognizes that. This makes God not the <em>source</em> of rightness or wrongness, but rather the all-wise communicator of that to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plato/Socrates: the second option makes more sense, and it makes rightness and wrongness possible to discuss independent of knowing God&rsquo;s will per se.</p>
<p>God can still be the most important source of understanding about right/wrong, and also the creator of everything.</p>
<p>Are these equally plausible/appealing?</p>
