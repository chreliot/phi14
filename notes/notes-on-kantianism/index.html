<h2 id="whats-intrinsically-valuable">What&rsquo;s intrinsically valuable?</h2>
<p>Some things seem inappropriate to feel happy about.</p>
<ul>
<li>happiness about bad things [gruesome death? cruelty? cruel thoughts?]</li>
<li>happiness out of step with reality</li>
</ul>
<p>(BUT: says the Utilitarian, the happiness itself is still good even if we object to its source)</p>
<p>Kant: The one and only thing that&rsquo;s intrinsically valuable is the good will.</p>
<p>Will: Capacity to push desires toward actions, or the capacity to choose and try to act on goals</p>
<p>Acting rightly or wrongly applies just to beings with wills. So, having a will is a special thing. A will that chooses the right goals is intrinsically valuable — the only thing that is.</p>
<p>Note that this makes different things valuable (in comparison with Utilitarianism): persons (those with wills), or beings capable of rational choice/reasoning</p>
<h2 id="when-is-willing-good">When is willing good?</h2>
<p>For Kant, as for his contemporaries, the world is full of purposes — the laws of nature seem to reflect God&rsquo;s purposes, for example. And nature is governed by laws of nature.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the exception to everything moving according to the laws of nature (or physics)? We are able to choose. We have free will (to a degree). We can choose purposes.</p>
<p>Kant supposes that when we will something, we do that with an implicit maxim:</p>
<p>Willing something involves: a situation, an action, and a purpose.</p>
<p>A maxim of action expresses those three: “If I&rsquo;m at Hofstra (situation), and I want coffee (purpose), I&rsquo;ll go to Starbucks (action).” We are constantly laying out such maxims for ourselves, in our minds.</p>
<h2 id="kants-first-categorical-imperative">Kant&rsquo;s first categorical imperative</h2>
<p>This is a rule about which maxims we should and shouldn&rsquo;t will — what makes will good (or bad).</p>
<p>“Act only in such a way that your maxim could be a universal law of nature.”</p>
<p>When made universal, could your maxim be a law of nature?  A maxim is made universal when it, like a law, applies to everyone.</p>
<p>Maxim: If I&rsquo;m at Hofstra and I want coffee, I&rsquo;ll go to Starbucks.
Universalized: Anyone who&rsquo;s at Hofstra and wants coffee should go to Starbucks.</p>
<p>Kant: Could that universalized maxim be a law of nature? Could the universe exist where that universalized maxim was added to the existing laws of nature?</p>
<p>If yes: the maxim is morally okay to will
If no: the maxim is not morally okay to will</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maxim: If I&rsquo;m feeling sad, and I want to feel better, I&rsquo;ll approach someone for help.</li>
<li>Universalized: Everyone who&rsquo;s feeling sad and wants to feel better will approach someone for help.</li>
<li>Test: Could a universe exist that had this as a law of nature? Sure! So, it&rsquo;s (morally) okay.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maxim: If I&rsquo;m experiencing financial hardship, and I want to fix that, so I will borrow some money from someone, making a lying promise to return it.</li>
<li>Universalized: Everyone experiencing financial hardship who wants to fix that will borrow some money from someone, making a lying promise to return it.</li>
<li>Is this universe possible: No. Promising, in this universe, would never be a way of bringing about any purpose like getting money. So, this universe isn&rsquo;t possible. (If lying promises aren&rsquo;t a possible way to achieve purposes, nobody could make them to achieve purposes.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Kant concludes that willing on <em>this</em> maxim yields &ldquo;a contradiction in the will.&rdquo; So, it&rsquo;s wrong to will it.</p>
<p>This is a more precise way of thinking about when we make exceptions of ourselves — that being an indicator that we&rsquo;re doing something wrong.</p>
<h2 id="categorical-imperatives-in-general">Categorical imperatives, in general</h2>
<p>An “imperative” is something we must do.</p>
<p>Kant divides imperatives into 2 kinds: hypothetical and categorical.</p>
<ul>
<li>hypothetical imperatives: describe what we should do contingent on our purposes;</li>
<li>categorical imperatives: describe what we should <em>always</em> do, not contingent on any further purpose, but because everyone must do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, he wonders <em>Are there</em> any categorical imperatives apply to all reasoning beings — everything with a will?</p>
<p>Why is the first categorical imperative categorical? If will in a way that conflicts with it, that produces a contradiction in our wills — we&rsquo;re no longer rational.</p>
<p>So, this makes morality rational. Good thinking requires morality.</p>
<h2 id="kants-second-categorical-imperative">Kant&rsquo;s second categorical imperative</h2>
<p>“<strong>Act in such a way that you always treat humanity — whether in others or yourself — always as an end in itself, and never merely as a means.</strong>” (“The formula of humanity”)</p>
<p>Something is a means to an end, when it is done to bring about that end (purpose).</p>
<p>Is it ever okay to treat someone else as a means to our ends (purposes)?</p>
<p>Are we using anyone (without their full knowledge)?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>marrying someone just for financial benefits, when they think something else is going on [bad]</li>
<li>marrying someone for financial benefits, if they&rsquo;re happy about the arrangement [okay]</li>
<li>the police use a criminal as an informant in exchange for reduced sentence [okay, for Kant: okay]</li>
<li>&lsquo;ratting out&rsquo; your conspirators in exchange for a reduced sentence [mixed opinions, depends, for Kant: wrong]</li>
</ul>
<p>In never treating people merely as means, we try to avoid using them without respecting their ability to set their own ends/purposes. People with wills are capable of setting their own purposes. We interfere with their ability to do that when we undermine their ability to choose freely among alternatives, for example with full knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to use people as means, just never as merely means.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing someone&rsquo;s secrets for your own gain</li>
<li>using someone with their full knowledge and agreement, but in a way that harms them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kants-third-formulation-of-the-categorical-imperative">Kant&rsquo;s third formulation of the categorical imperative</h2>
<p>This arguably blends the ideas of the first two. The first had us think of our maxims of action as laws, but like laws of science. The third asks us to think of them as like laws of a nation. But it wraps that together with treating others always as ends in themselves (so, not merely as means).</p>
<p><strong>Act only in such a way that your maxim could be a law of a kingdom where the subjects are all ends in themselves.</strong>  (“The kingdom of ends formulation”)</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t ever act in a way that, if our maxim of action became a law, it would treat people as less than ends in themselves.</p>
<h2 id="strengths-of-kantianism">Strengths of Kantianism</h2>
<ol>
<li>It brings out that making an exception of ourselves is a sign that we&rsquo;re doing something we shouldn&rsquo;t do.</li>
<li>It brings out that an important way of doing something wrong is that we use others without their full consent.</li>
<li>Attributes exceptionless moral value to individual persons.</li>
<li>Attempts to make acting wrongly <em>irrational</em> — to prove what it considers wrong is necessarily wrong.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="criticisms-of-kantianism">Criticisms of Kantianism</h2>
<ol>
<li>Kantianism makes us have to respect the wills of people with nefarious goals, without exception.
<ul>
<li>but shouldn&rsquo;t we lie to a murderer at the door, despite that the categorical imperatives say never to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any moral value that non-persons have is completely derived from obligations to people. So, it might turn out okay to abuse animals — or at least, there&rsquo;s nothing obviously, directly wrong with that. But it&rsquo;s not okay.</li>
<li>Almost no current philosophers think Kant succeeds at proving that the categorical imperatives are categorically true.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-golden-rule">The Golden Rule:</h2>
<p>“Treat others as you yourself would want to be treated.”</p>
<p>(in the Christian tradition see Matthew 7:12, also Confucianism, et al.)</p>
<p>This sounds a <em>lot</em> like the second formulation of the categorical imperative (“humanity”).</p>
<p>Kant says that the second formulation is <em>not</em> identical to the Golden Rule, and is better.</p>
<p>Can you think of any situations where these two recommendations differ? And which has the better answer?</p>
