<li>If it&rsquo;s in your power to save a life, you should, so long as you don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice something worth as much.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>even if there are others better positioned to help, who aren&rsquo;t helping</li>
<li>even if they&rsquo;re from another country</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="singers-argument">Singer&rsquo;s argument</h2>
<ol>
<li>If it&rsquo;s in our power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance, we ought (morally) to do that.</li>
<li>Suffering towards death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care is bad.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s in power to prevent (some) suffering towards death from lack of those things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, we ought (morally) to contribute to preventing suffering towards death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care.</p>
<p>(If we don&rsquo;t do that, but we embrace the premises, we&rsquo;re hypocrites!)</p>
<h2 id="objections">Objections</h2>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s my money, and I can do what I want with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: Yes, but you&rsquo;ve agreed that you &ldquo;should (morally)&rdquo; use it in a particular way. The right to use it doesn&rsquo;t conflict with the moral &ldquo;should.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This is communism/socialism, and I dislike redistribution of wealth.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: No, this has nothing to do with governments taking our money.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>This sounds hard. It requires thinking about whether we could do more than we&rsquo;re doing. I&rsquo;m happy to give to charity, but not to constantly review whether I can do more.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: We can distinguish between right actions that fulfill <em>duties</em> (what we must do) and right actions that are <em>supererogatory</em> (beyond what&rsquo;s required, beyond duty). Our obligations to help with suffering towards death aren&rsquo;t merely supererogatory.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Charities are scammy. Why would I ever donate through them?</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: Our obligation is to help, efficiently, not to waste our money!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>I prefer to help in my community rather than sending money to another country.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: If there are things you can help with in your community that are of comparable moral significance, do! But, if not, then our obligation is to help elsewhere.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>My mental health benefit from vacationing in Aruba is morally valuable!</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: We must ask whether it&rsquo;s <em>of comparable moral significance</em> to the suffering that could be prevented with that expense.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>If everyone gives everything not-morally-comparable, this might ruin our economy and well-being while making others rich.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: If everyone actually contributed, the cost to each of us would be extremely low. So, no economic scenario like that could occur. Our obligation (based on the idea of comparable moral significance is to help people up to the level of marginal utility).</p>
<p>“Marginal utility” = the level at which below it, your trajectory is toward suffering and death, but above it you&rsquo;re stable.</p>
<p>Any giving to others that brings them above marginal utility becomes supererogatory.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Direct relief is a short-term solution. We need long term solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT: The moral principle above suggests we address both.</p>
