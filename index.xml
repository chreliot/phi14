      <description>Instructions To take this test, you do not need to log in to Zoom. All the instructions appear below. However, there will be a Zoom session open during our assigned exam time (10:30–12:30), where you can find me on chat. After that, please contact me through email with any questions.
The following questions are designed to take you not more than 90 minutes. This is a final assessment, not a big project.</description>
