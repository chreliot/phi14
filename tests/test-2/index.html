<p>This test is designed to take one hour. Complete it during the exam period (designated as 10:30–12:30). Tests submitted by 12:45 PM on May 19 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at <code>[the course Blackboard site] &gt; Tests &gt; Test 2.</code> Note that the Turnitin interface is apparently new.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Choose <strong>six (6)</strong> of the questions below under “<strong>Questions</strong>” to work on. For each of those six questions, write a one-paragraph answer, not shorter than five sentences. For most, 6–7 sentences is a good range to aim for, in terms of length (though sentences vary in terms of content, of course, and very brief sentences may not convey as much as I&rsquo;m assuming in my estimate). Please number your answer with the number of the question asked.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your understanding of the course material. That includes the clarity of the answer, which includes defining any technical or unfamiliar terms you&rsquo;re using and writing in clear English.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials-and-assistance">Source materials and assistance</h2>
<p>While taking the test, you may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else (besides me, and I won&rsquo;t give anyone the answers). For the test answers, you <em>may</em> use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your class/reading notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text <em>from non-course materials or other students, without mentioning that you have done so in the form of a citation</em>,  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). More generally, in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> apparent degree of understanding — test answers repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that the test-takers not seem to understand will not earn good grades.</p>
