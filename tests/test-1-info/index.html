<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>The test will be designed to take about an hour on average, and to take not more than 85 minutes (which is to say, class time).</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short (5–8 sentences), separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions that are reproduced in the list of “Possible test questions” below. That list is a test bank of <em>possible</em> questions, some of which are the actual questions that will be on the test, exactly as they will be written on the test. Other questions on the list will not be included in the test. You won&rsquo;t know which questions will appear on the test until you take it. But having the whole test bank available to you will help you study the right content.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>Consult the questions below, make sure you understand them, and that they make sense to you as questions connected with your reading and notes from class. Think about possible answers.</p>
<p>To consider possible content for test answers, consider the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main ideas for each of the readings and/or class presentations.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, as if to help them understand.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-and-materials">Collaboration and materials</h2>
<p>Before the test, you may work together to discuss possible answers. During the test you may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else. During the test, you may not use any written or printed materials and all electronic devices must be put away. You will need only a writing implement.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-instructions">Actual test instructions</h2>
<p>Choose <strong>six (6)</strong> of the questions on the following pages to work on. For each of those six questions, write a one-paragraph answer on that page, not shorter than five sentences. Six or seven sentences is a good range to aim for, in terms of length—though sentences vary in terms of content, of course, and very brief sentences may not convey as much as I&rsquo;m assuming in my estimate. There is no limit on length, but a longer answer is not necessarily better; quality is much more important than quality.</p>
<p>Please try to write clearly, as I can only give credit to answers I can read and understand.</p>
<p>When you are finished, please return the test sheet to me at the front of the room.</p>
<h2 id="possible-test-questions">Possible test questions</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Why, according to Glaucon (in Plato), might injustice be better than justice? If injustice is better, why — according to him — would people ever behave justly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Socrates (in Plato) argue that even if God(s) command(s) us to do what&rsquo;s right, that can&rsquo;t be what <em>makes</em> moral facts true?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might someone support, with an argument, the claim “If God is dead, then everything is permitted?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s a reason that could support that everything human beings do (or can do) is selfish? Then, in just 1–2 sentences, what&rsquo;s a reason to doubt that that&rsquo;s true?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are two ways that human beings having been shaped by natural selection might threaten the substance of philosophical ethics?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might humans having been shaped by natural selection promote human altruistic and cooperative behaviors?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Rachels demonstrate that moral relativism is false? What exactly does he show in his article?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the threat to philosophical ethics from false consciousness? Then, in 1–2 sentences, how does Blackburn counter that it&rsquo;s not a serious threat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How might we apply the Greatest Happiness Principle to any actual situation? What would we need to pay attention to and reason about?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the objection to Utilitarianism from the idea of human dignity, as discussed by Mill, that is sometimes also called “the swine objection,” because it involves pigs. How does Mill reply to it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exactly how much should we do for others, if Singer&rsquo;s analysis is correct—or, more precisely—how should we reason our way to understanding exactly how much we should do?</p>
</li>
</ol>
