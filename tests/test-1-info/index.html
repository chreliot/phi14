<p>The first test, on Wednesday March 24, will be released at the beginning of the class session (11:20 AM) through a Blackboard announcement. The test is designed to take one hour. You may complete it during the class session, or you may submit it later in the day. Tests submitted any time on March 24 will be on time. Submit through the upload link at the course Blackboard site &gt; Tests &gt; Test 1.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>All but one of the topics for this section of the course were, following Blackburn&rsquo;s presentation in <em>Being Good</em>, threats to ethics. Specifically, they were threats to (1) whether ethical statements could be true or substantive, and to (2) whether the project of philosophical ethics — of our working together to figure out what&rsquo;s right and wrong — can succeed. Then, we examined Utilitarianism as a first attempt to ground the truth of ethical claims and to establish what&rsquo;s right and wrong.</p>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main arguments for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of five short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your understanding of the course material.</p>
<h2 id="source-materials">Source materials</h2>
<p>You may not help each other, or communicate with other students about your tests or theirs, or ask for help with the test material from anyone else. For the test, you may use the assigned readings/texts for the course and your notes without mentioning them as the sources of any ideas. It is simply assumed that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re using. You are discouraged, but not prohibited, from accessing other materials.  However, in line with the academic honesty policy for this course described in the syllabus, any incorporation into your answers of ideas or text from non-course materials or other students <em>without mentioning that you have done so</em>  will be grounds for earning an F for the course (and the other consequences prescribed by Hofstra Faculty Policy Series 11). And in light of the evaluation criterion above — that I will be assessing each student&rsquo;s test on how well they reveal <em>that student&rsquo;s</em> understanding — students repeating ideas or text from elsewhere that they do not understand will not earn good grades.</p>
