      <description>Format The test will be designed take you not more than 90 minutes, but you will have two hours (120 minutes) to complete it.
You will be asked to write answers to six of the questions presented by the test. There will be at least eight options on the test, so that you can skip two. If you answer more than six, I will grade only the first six, so you should choose which questions you think you understand best, and answer those.</description>

      <description>Instructions The test will be designed to take about an hour on average, and to take not more than 85 minutes (which is to say, class time).
Format The test will consist of six short (5–8 sentences), separate paragraphs you&amp;rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions that are reproduced in the list of “Possible test questions” below. That list is a test bank of possible questions, some of which are the actual questions that will be on the test, exactly as they will be written on the test.</description>
