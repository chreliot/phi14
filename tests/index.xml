      <description>Instructions The test will be designed to take about an hour on average, and to take not more than 85 minutes (which is to say, class time).
Format The test will consist of six short (5–8 sentences), separate paragraphs you&amp;rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions that are reproduced in the list of “Possible test questions” below. That list is a test bank of possible questions, some of which are the actual questions that will be on the test, exactly as they will be written on the test.</description>
