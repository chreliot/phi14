<h2 id="general-instructions">General instructions</h2>
<p>The test will be designed take you not more than 90 minutes, but you will have two hours (120 minutes) to complete it. You will need to write answers in pen, on paper. Your answer should be in sentences rather than fragments or bullet points or similar (unless something else is specified by the question).</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>You will be asked to write answers to six of the questions presented by the test. There will be at least eight options on the test, so that you can skip two. If you answer more than six, I will grade only the first six, so you should choose which questions you think you understand best, and answer those.</p>
<p>The answer to each question should be a minimum of five sentences, and perhaps several more sentences than that, since minimal answers are not always excellent answers.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This test will cover the whole course, but with a strong emphasis on the second half.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>Consider the Learning Questions for each unit, review your notes on the texts, and think through each of the actual test questions, listed below.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, towards helping them understand. I will try to read them as if I&rsquo;m a student who is not in the course and think about how well I understand the content based on your answer and explanation.</p>
