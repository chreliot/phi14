<main>
<p>Having considered the major moral theories of recent philosophical ethics, we think through the moral dimensions of some cases. What do each of the theories have to say about them? Are the theories, as we&rsquo;ve discussed them, adequate for analyzing these cases?</p>
<h2 id="readingviewing">Reading/viewing</h2>
<p><em>For each of these films, consider making a few notes that prepare you to discuss them.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9ttMAQr_A"><strong><em>Moral Dilemmas … Can Ethics Help?</em></strong></a> (1998, Intelecom, 28 min.). Freely available on YouTube at the link.</p>
<ul>
<li>This film considers the wrenching situation of a couple newborn babies struggling for life as well as their families and medical staff.</li>
<li>The way the participants and narrator frame their moral dilemma might differ from your way of understanding it, including even in language. “Handicapped,” for just one example, is a word that, since 1998, people have widely come to object to. Treat this as an artifact from 1998, and think about whether you agree with its various ways of presenting and analyzing the situation. View critically, as always!</li>
<li>You will recognize from our course authors at least two of the philosophers and bioethicists who offer (conflicting) analysis—Martha Nussbaum and James Rachels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch: <strong><em>Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room</em></strong> (2005, dir. Alex Gibney, 1 h 49 min.) [<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268/">IMDB listing</a>]</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re probably going to have to pay to stream this one, sorry, unless you somehow have access. It&rsquo;s currently $0.99 to stream at Apple and Amazon, $2.99 on YouTube, etc. (Hofstra owns the DVD, but not streaming rights.)</li>
<li>The film dissects the decline and fall of the seventh  largest corporation in the United States at that time.</li>
<li>Note the film is rated R, with brief nudity, some swearing, and a dramatized suicide from a distance. I suspect you can handle that, but this maybe isn&rsquo;t one to watch with your local 10 year-old?</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h2 id="learning-questions">Learning questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What do each of the three major moral theories (Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Virtue Ethics) bring out about these non-fiction cases and the various people involved in them?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="consider">Consider</h2>
<ol>
<li>How well do the three major moral theories do at bringing out the moral dimensions of these cases? Are there aspects or dimensions they get wrong?</li>
<li>Are there aspects of these situations the moral theories <em>miss</em>—that they fail to reveal the moral significance of? If so, what are they?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="see-also">See also</h2>
<p><em>Are there any films you want to recommend as thought-provoking about ethics?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Touching the Void</em> (2003, documentary, dir. Kevin Macdonald, 106 min.) — A pair of mountain-climbers face a potentially-deadly situation; one is forced to make a terrible decision.</li>
