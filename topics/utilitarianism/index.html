<h1><span class="title">Topic 7: Utilitarianism</span></h1>

</div>

<main>
<p>In this section, we encounter our first, comprehensive, positive theory of what&rsquo;s right (and wrong) to do, and why. Utilitarianism, built from the idea that happiness is obviously valuable, resembles a variety of earlier philosophies that do the same, but developed its particular approach from the 18th Century forward. We begin with a slightly later Utilitarian philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, who developed a sophisticated defense of it in the 19th Century.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/mill1863.pdf"><em>Utilitarianism</em></a> by John Stuart Mill, 1863. Read Chapter 2 on your own. Also,  short sections of Chapters 1 and 4 will be discussed in class.
<ul>
<li>The above, assigned Early Modern Texts version has been modernized by philosopher Jonathan Bennett from the original, in word choice and sentence structure (<a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/faqs/why">Why?</a> <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/faqs/how">How?</a>). You are welcome check out the original, 19th century English version just as Mill wrote it <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224">here</a>.</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s an <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/mobile/mill1863.epub">Epub version</a> if you&rsquo;d like to read it on a Kindle, tablet, etc.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="learning-questions">Learning questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Why might people find it confusing, as Mill discusses, to think that the “useful” could be the same as the “good” and the “right”?</li>
<li>What does “the Greatest Happiness Principle” say, and what does it mean?</li>
<li>How might we apply the Greatest Happiness Principle to any actual situation? What would we need to pay attention to and reason about?</li>
<li>What is the objection to Utilitarianism from the idea of “higher pleasures” as discussed by Mill? (This is sometimes also called “the swine objection.”) How does Mill reply to it?</li>
<li>What is Singer&rsquo;s main argument for what we should do for others in the world?</li>
<li>Exactly how much should we do for others, if Singer&rsquo;s analysis is correct—or, more precisely—how should we reason our way to understanding exactly how much we should do?</li>
