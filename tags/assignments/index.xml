      <description>In our readings so far this semester, we have been observing authors making claims, considering possible objections to the support for those claims, and then replying to the objections, in order to solidify their original claims. We have observed repeatedly how good objections do not just deny others&amp;rsquo; claims or conclusions. Rather, they try to show that at least one reason offered in support of the conclusion might actually not be a good reason to accept it.</description>
