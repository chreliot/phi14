      <title>Notes on Reasons and Foundations</title>

      <description>Blackburn distinguishes:
 reasons (r): motivating considerations for those who care about them Reasons (R): motivation considerations for EVERYONE, independent of their sympathies and inclinations (what they care about and their feelings)  So, are there any &amp;ldquo;Reasons&amp;rdquo;? Are there sources of rightness/goodness that should motivate everyone (all rational beings)?
Egoism Profitability/benefits for me (the person motivated by the reason)
  BUT: This considers only individual goods. So, to the extent that this is the source of goodness, ethics, in the sense of a community establishing what&amp;rsquo;s right, becomes impossible.</description>

      <description>Cases  How do the 3 major theories of philosophical ethics apply to real situations? Do the three theories each/all succeed at revealing the ethical dimensions of the real situations? Are there other ethical dimensions of the cases in addition to what these theories highlight?  Enron An amoral analysis of the case Some very creative entrepreneurs created new markets, buying and selling what had never been traded before, and they made a lot of money doing that.</description>

      <description>Moral dilemmas … can ethics help? What is the moral dilemma?
 keep newborns alive by any means necessary allow them to pass away peacefully  Utilitarian considerations 4–5% (?) chance that the newborns, if treated, would develop severe disabilities, potentially reducing their quality of life, and making them dependent on others. (Would the newborns be unhappy in their lives, in comparison with ending them?)
Would people&amp;rsquo;s time and resources be unnecessarily consumed by taking care of the infants, where it could also be spent on other goods?</description>

      <description>Objections:  Even if all human lives involve the &amp;ldquo;grounding experience&amp;rdquo; that calls for each of the virtues — for example, facing dangers, to which &amp;ldquo;courage&amp;rdquo; is the proper response, we may be left with &amp;ldquo;competing answers to a single general question about a set of shared human experiences, … and what has been achieved is, at best, a single discourse or debate about virtue.”    Objector: Virtue ethics is susceptible to relativism *Virtue Theorist: But the grounding spheres of experience are common to all human lives * Objector: But this shows we can have a shared debate about what the right reponse to them is.</description>

      <title>Notes on Virtue 3</title>

      <description>Criticisms of virtue ethics   How do we get to be virtuous? Aristotle doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a recipe. BUT: What about the virtuous mean idea? Aim at the middle. BUT: 50% of the excessive amount of a behavior is normally NOT an amount to aim for. BUT: Also, we tend individually (or collectively) to err on one side or the other, so aiming at the midpoint won&amp;rsquo;t bring us to the middle way.</description>

      <title>Notes on Kantianism 2</title>

      <description>Utilitarianism vs. Kantianism Consider:
 Could we actually deploy these theories in our own thinking and acting? If we did deploy them, would we be behaving well — acting rightly and avoiding wrongs?  Responses   It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to apply either of the moral theories to situations from scratch.
 BUT: if we routinely apply the theories, they can come to be unconscious habits or have straightforward prescriptions - Kantianism generally yields classes of actions that are right or wrong: using people solely as means is wrong; lying is wrong.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s intrinsically valuable? Some things seem inappropriate to feel happy about.
 happiness about bad things [gruesome death? cruelty? cruel thoughts?] happiness out of step with reality  (BUT: says the Utilitarian, the happiness itself is still good even if we object to its source)
Kant: The one and only thing that&amp;rsquo;s intrinsically valuable is the good will.
Will: Capacity to push desires toward actions, or the capacity to choose and try to act on goals</description>

      <description>The expediency objection Philippa Foot:
 A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients.</description>

      <description>If it&amp;rsquo;s in your power to save a life, you should, so long as you don&amp;rsquo;t have to sacrifice something worth as much.   even if there are others better positioned to help, who aren&amp;rsquo;t helping even if they&amp;rsquo;re from another country  Singer&amp;rsquo;s argument  If it&amp;rsquo;s in our power to prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance, we ought (morally) to do that.</description>

      <title>Notes on False Consciousness</title>

      <description>Suppose a person “behaves as he does because of a system or socially institutionalized set of behaviors that are entrenched in the society, and that the function of the system” is sometimes opaque/not completely visible to the actor.
The actor in this situation exhibits false consciousness, because of the gap between what he thinks he&amp;rsquo;s doing (and why) and what he&amp;rsquo;s actually doing (and why).
 He thinks: he&amp;rsquo;s being kind / chivalrous.</description>

      <description>Evolutionary theory Evolution by natural selection: If organisms have heritable (= can be inherited, passed from parents to offspring) characteristics in which they vary from one another, and some of those variations contribute to their survival-to-reproduce and reproduction), then we will tend to see an increase in those beneficial characteristics over time. Most of the diversity of living things can be explained this way.
Ethics is a behavior. So, can we explain it by natural selection?</description>

      <title>Notes on Egoism</title>

      <description>Psychological egoism = “the doctrine that the only thing anyone is capable of desiring or pursuing ultimately (as an end in itself) is his own self interest.” (Feinberg)
Why a threat to philosophical ethics?
Exclusively pursuing our self interest precludes pursuing others&#39; interests. And pursuing others&#39; interests (&amp;ldquo;altruism&amp;rdquo;) is one thing Ethics should prescribe.
Reason egoism might be true?
We can (cynically) analyze every possible case of potentially/nominally-altruistic behavior as really merely selfish.</description>

      <description>In what way are moral claims true/false? [for example, &amp;ldquo;Murder is wrong.&amp;quot;]
&amp;ldquo;Chocolate is delicious.&amp;rdquo; Is that true? Why or why not? &amp;ldquo;The Earth is round.&amp;rdquo; Is that true? Why or why not?
Ways of being true/false (or not)  Realism - Statements are true when they match reality (false when they don&amp;rsquo;t). Non-realism - Statements neither match nor fail to match reality; any opinion is as good as any other.</description>

      <title>Notes on Euthyphro</title>

      <description>Euthyphro (Plato) Where: outside the courthouse
hoison = piety, holiness, righteousness, respectfulness toward gods, respectfulness
Socrates is facing trial for
 corrupting the youth rejecting the gods of Athens (lacking hoison) inventing false gods  Socrates defends his actions as displaying hoison
Euthyphro is at court pressing charges against his father
Socrates reacts with surprise at Euthyphro&amp;rsquo;s impiety towards his father — his lack of hoison
The Euthyphro dilemma  But if in fact what is dear to the gods and the holy were the same, my friend, then, if the holy were loved because it is holy, what is dear to the gods would be loved because it is dear to the gods; but if what is dear to the gods were dear to the gods because the gods love it, the holy would be holy because it is loved.</description>

      <title>Notes on God</title>

      <description>Two threats from God First threat Fyodr Dostoevksy&amp;rsquo;s Brothers Karamazov, roughly: “If God is dead, everything is permitted” (= if there is no god, nothing is really unethical/wrong)
If God is a legislator of morality, then if there&amp;rsquo;s no God, there are or could be no rules of morality. Nothing is wrong.
Possible answers  God exists, and God legislates morality, and God backs up moral rules with reward/punishment. Though God doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, atheists nonetheless behave well because they find moral truths elsewhere.</description>

      <description>This note about grading and interpreting grades just adds some detail to what the course syllabus already says about grading.
 4-point scale Writing assignment grades Test grades Overall course grades    4-point scale Grades in this course are assigned and calculated using Hofstra&amp;rsquo;s 4-point scale (described here in the Hofstra Bulletin). Following the Bulletin, the alphabetical grades, including plus (+) and minus (–), have the following 4-point scale values (and vice versa):</description>

      <guid>https://chreliot.github.io/phi14/notes/participation-rubric/</guid>
      <description>This is the participation rubric to be used for grading participation in this course. Read it as saying “A student who demonstrates … earns a grade of X,” where X is the letter grade at the top of the column.1
   A B C D F     Active role in discussions, drawing on texts Regular, constructive participation drawing on texts Inconsistent constructive participation based on texts Vague comments reflecting limited engagement with texts Persistent lack of engagement with texts   Full preparation for approximately every class Substantial preparation, normally Inconsistent evidence of preparation Rare evidence of participation No positive evidence of participation   Success at advancing level and depth of discussion, persistently Regular contributions based on assigned material, which sometimes improve discussion and never diminish it Rare or no significant contribution to the level of discussion while not reducing it Activity sometimes diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment Activity regularly diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment   Active engagement with and listening to peers, persistently Sincere efforts to interact with peers, normally Limited engagement with peers Rare interaction with peers No interaction with peers      This rubric is significantly based on, and lightly adapted from, one written by another philosophy professor, Jay Odenbaugh.</description>
