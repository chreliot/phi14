<p>For this writing assignment, you will use two moral theories to analyze a particular activity and think about which moral theory, in your view, does a better job of bringing out its moral dimensions.</p>
<p>First, include a introductory, summarizing paragraph (which I recommend write <em>last</em>, after you&rsquo;ve written all the rest, but place first), construct the following paragraphs. Each numbered item represents a paragraph; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be long.</p>
<p>Second, write at least 400 words using one of the three main moral theories we discussed in depth — Kantianism (in either Kant&rsquo;s or Korsgaard&rsquo;s versions, or both), Mill&rsquo;s Utilitarianism, and Aristotle&rsquo;s Virtue Ethics — to analyze the ways in which a specific activity might be right or wrong according to that theory. For the activity, choose one from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a recreational drug known to cause significant harm to oneself (perhaps, e.g., heroin or methamphetamine?);</li>
<li>allowing betting on sporting events;</li>
<li>flying long distances for fun on jets that emit climate-altering gasses;</li>
<li>uploading answers for a course&rsquo;s final exam to a public, commercial website;</li>
<li>making claims, during a political campaign, about what one will do, if elected, that will probably not be able to be achieved;</li>
<li>driving 80 miles per hour on the highway where the speed limit is 55 MPH;</li>
<li>“doxxing” people one thinks have done egregiously bad things (that is, sharing their address and other information publicly online in retaliation);</li>
<li>engaging in and/or soliciting prostitution;</li>
<li>buying low-cost clothing produced by companies known to pay workers exceptionally low wages and otherwise treat workers badly;</li>
<li>advertising a product as healing when it has no proven health benefits (perhaps, e.g, a power crystal); or,</li>
<li>telling children falsely that they will get painful electric shocks if they touch paintings at  museums (a friend of mine does this).</li>
</ul>
<p>Third, in another (at least) 400 words, analyze the same case from the perspective of a different one of the main three moral theories.</p>
<p>Fourth, in another (at least) 400 words, argue that one or the other of the two theories you&rsquo;ve discussed does a better job highlighting the moral dimensions of the case. Draw on general features of the moral theory to highlight its strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures, as they are revealed by your analyses in the previous two sections.</p>
<p>The total essay, including each of the parts above, should be at least 1200 words long. For guidance on style, goals, and citation, see <a href="/phi14/WritingAPhilosophyPaper-2021.pdf">“Writing a Philosophy Paper” (linked)</a>.</p>
<p>Upload your paper through Blackboard upload, under the Assignments button, any day or time before noon on Monday, December 19. Please do not write your name at the top, so I can provide some anonymous feedback and evaluation.</p>
