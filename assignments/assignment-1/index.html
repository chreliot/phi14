<main>
<p>In our readings so far this semester, we have been observing authors making claims, considering possible objections to the support for those claims, and then replying to the objections, in order to solidify their original claims. We have observed repeatedly how good objections do not just deny others&rsquo; claims or conclusions.  Rather, they try to show that at least one reason offered in support of the conclusion might actually not be a good reason to accept it. For this writing assignment, that is what you will do.</p>
<p>The claim you will be thinking about has been a theme for through the first part of this course, that “it is better to act justly than to act unjustly.” We have considered a series of reasons why it might be wrong or misguided to say that.</p>
<p>Your response should take the form of a prose essay (rather than, say, a series of separate answers), but it should include all of the following parts, in the following order. Pay attention to the word minimums.</p>
<h2 id="expressing-the-problem">Expressing the problem</h2>
<p>First, in at least 250 words, express the problem the essay will respond to. The problem should be a reason that it might be wrong or misguided to say that “it is better to act justly than to act unjustly.” The reason does not need to be your own, original reason that you came up with; it can draw on one of the texts we read. And indeed, in your expressing it, you should use a relevant quotation one of the texts assigned for this course so far. (And whenever you introduce any quotation in an essay, you should briefly contextualize and explain it.)</p>
<h2 id="answering-the-problem">Answering the problem</h2>
<p>Second, in at least 500 words, offer a reason why — the problem in the first section notwithstanding — it is <em>right</em> to conclude that “it is better to act justly than to act unjustly.” Your reason in this section does not need to be able to be compressed into a single sentence. That is, it might be able to be summarized in a single sentence, but it may — and indeed should —  take more than one sentence to express and explain. In this section, again use a brief, targeted quotation from a text from our course (similarly contextualized and explained) that helps support or explain your reason.  You may, in developing this reason, build on ideas expressed in the course texts (with page references back to those texts) but you may also depart from them in developing your own original reason.</p>
<h2 id="challenging-that-answer-and-deflecting-the-challenge">Challenging that answer, and deflecting the challenge</h2>
<p>Third, in at least 250 words, (a) express a possible objection to your reason from section two, and (b) respond to it in a way that solidifies your reason. Try here, in your thinking at least, to adopt the point of view of someone who disagrees with the conclusion that “it is better to act justly than to act unjustly,” and so is trying to poke holes in the reason you have offered in support of that conclusion. What might they think is wrong with it? And also in this section, as I said, try to explain how that objection does <em>not</em> undermine the reasoning you have offered earlier in the essay.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective-overview">Retrospective overview</h2>
<p>Finally, in at least 50 words, summarize what the essay has argued.</p>
<p>The total essay, including each of the parts above, should be at least 1200 words long. For guidance on style and citation, see <a href="/phi14/WritingAPhilosophyPaper-2021.pdf">“Writing a Philosophy Paper” (linked)</a>.</p>
<p>Please upload your essay through Blackboard, to the Assignment 1 upload link, under the Assignments button. Upload the essay by March 15.</p>
