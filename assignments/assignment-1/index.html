<main>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve spent time with each of the three major (most prominent, most discussed) theories of recent philosophical ethics, and  have thought about how to apply them to a few hypothetical situations, I want you to think about how you would apply them to real situations.</p>
<p>Find in you memory a real example of a choice that has moral dimensions, as experienced by you or someone you directly know. It could be a dilemma—a situation in which there are two or more seemingly-compelling options—but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be.</p>
<p>Briefly present the case and analyze how at least two of the theories (Utilitarianism, Kantianism, and/or Virtue Ethics) might recommend reasoning about it. Write at least 250 words.</p>
<p>Post your case and analysis to the course discussion board on Blackboard, changing any names and details as is necessary to protect your privacy or other people&rsquo;s privacy while maintaining the structure of the real case.</p>
<p>Then, post at least one substantive comment of at least 50 words on at least one other student&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Complete this by May 5, the sooner the better, and I will post a grade for you individually as soon as you complete both parts.</p>
<p>Please feel welcome to write more than the minimum, and to engage others in substantive/respectful discussion!</p>
<h3 id="grading-added-apr-21">Grading (added Apr 21)</h3>
<p>Your efforts will be graded, for this exercise, on how well they display your understanding of the major ethical theories and how to apply them to cases. The analyses that show more nuance — in particular, awareness of the details, strengths,  and limitations of the various approaches, or how they differ in what stands out to them as morally significant — will be graded higher.</p>
